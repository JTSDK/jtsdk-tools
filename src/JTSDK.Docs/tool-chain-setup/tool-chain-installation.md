# Installation

## Supported Tool Chain
* [JTSDK-Tools v3.0.0-7 Beta](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jtsdk/files/win32/3.0.0/beta-testing/)

As the tool-chain is updated, this package will track with those changes.

## Prerequisite Installaiton
In order to checkout and compile this package, the user must have two
utilities installed at the `system level`:
* [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/) (or comprable Git Client)
* Microsoft [.Net Core SDK v2.1.300](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows)
or later

Both packages must be available from a standard Windows Console. If not, users
should add--either locally or system wide--the path locations which allows access
to both `git` and `dotnet` command line tools. Using the commands `git --version`
and `dotnet --info` should render without error.
