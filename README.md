# JTSDK Net Core Applications
This repository is designed to work specifically with the JTSDK Version 3 series
tool-chain. It would be of little use elsewhere.

Delivery will be directly from the `master` branch. `Branches` will be used for
development and testing, while reserving the `master` branch in a stable
condition for end users. `Tags` will be use to archive milestones and will appear
in the [release section](https://github.com/KI7MT/jtsdk-dotnet-core/releases).

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests
For submitting bug reports and feature requests, use the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/KI7MT/jtsdk-dotnet-core/issues).

One of the main faulre points of `JTSDK v2` was the lack of flexablity and absence
of user request tracking. The aim of `JTSDK-Tools` is to use an Agile delivery
approach to create a high-quality, yet flexable build system. Utilizing Githubs 
[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/KI7MT/jtsdk-dotnet-core/issues)
users can quickly see the status of any particular request, discuss the merits,
and see the final disposition.

## Supported Operating Systems
At present, this repository only supports Windows. Later releases with include
generic Linux support, and additional Ubuntu / Debian specific artifacts.

### Linux
