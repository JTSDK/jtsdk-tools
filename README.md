# JTSDK Net Core Applications
This repository is designed to work specifically with the 
[JTSDK Version 3](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jtsdk/files/win32/3.0.0/release/)
tool-chain. It would be of little use elsewhere.

Delivery is directly from the `master` branch. 
- `Branches` are used for development and testing, while reserving the `master` branch in a stable
condition for end users. 
- `Tags` are used to archive milestones, and will appear
in the [release section](https://github.com/KI7MT/jtsdk-dotnet-core/releases).
